## Introduction

The Comments 2.0 plugin provides the ability to start or join a conversation by adding comments to the content within the TinyMCE editor. The Comments 2.0 plugin is built upon the [Annotations API]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/annotations/) and uses annotations to create comment threads (conversations).

Comments is a premium plugin from Tiny. Please see the [Premium features]({{site.baseurl}}/enterprise/tiny-comments/) section for all the buying options.

Once you have obtained the Comments 2.0 plugin, refer to the following instructions for using it.

### Modes

There are two modes available in Comments 2.0 that provide the ability to save comments. These modes are configured in the Comments 2.0settings.

* **Callback Mode** - This is the default mode in Comments. This mode is used to configure storage and save comments on user’s server. This option gives the user a choice to configure the storage settings to either persist comments immediately or save them at the same time as the content. Additional callbacks are required to be configured to use Comments in the callback mode. Refer to the [configuring callbacks for comments]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/configuring-comments-callbacks/) section, for more information.

* **Embedded Mode** - This mode allows the user to store the comments within the content. No additional callbacks are required to be configured to use this mode.

### Configuring Comments 2.0 embedded mode

To configure Comments 2.0 to use the embedded mode use the following script:

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "#textarea",
  menubar: 'file edit view insert format tools tc',
menu: {
 tc: {
  title: 'TinyComments',
  items: 'addcomment'
   }
 },
 tinycomments_author: 'Embedded Journalist',
 tinycomments_mode: 'embedded'
 ...
})
```

### Configuring the Comments 2.0 toolbar button

Use the following script to configure the Comments 2.0 toolbar button:

```js
tinymce.init({
 selector: "#textarea",
 toolbar: 'bold italic underline insertfile | addcomment',
 ...
})
```

Optional values: addcomment, showcomments

**Result**: The **Comments**  ![**Comments**]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comment-disabled.png) toolbar button appears in the toolbar menu. The function of this button is to add comments to selected text.

> Note: Currently, there are two toolbar buttons available:

* `addcomment` - Provides the ability to add comments.

* `showcomments`- Provides the ability to display comments field for the selected text. It is a toggle button and is used to hide the comments sidebar as well.


### Configuring the Comments 2.0 menu item

By default, when Comments 2.0 is added to the plugin list, the default menus will have entries for `addcomment` (Insert Menu), showcomments (View Menu), and deleteallconversations (File Menu).

For more information on configuring menu items refer to the [toolbar]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar) and [menu]({{site.baseurl}}/configure/editor-appearance/#menu) sections.

Currently, there are three menu items available:

* `addcomment` - Provides the ability to add comments. By default, this option can be accessed through **Insert** -> **Add comment** menu bar item.

* `showcomments`- Provides the ability to display comments field for the selected text. It is a toggle button and is used to hide the comments as well. By default, this option can be accessed through **View** -> **Show comment** menu bar item.

* `deleteallconversations`- Provides the ability to delete all the comments in the content. By default, this option can be accessed through **File** -> **Delete all conversations** menu bar item.

### Configuring the commented text properties

The editor needs to be configured to highlight the commented text. The following configuration is an example of displaying the text that the comment has been added to in a desired style:

```js
tinymce.init({
...
 content_style: '.mce-annotation { background: #fff0b7; } .tc-active-annotation {background: #ffe168; color: black; }',
 ...
})
```

**Result**: The commented text will be highlighted yellow.
